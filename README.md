## Overview

Base Maven projects on this artifact and you will get many pre-configuration benefits, 
including up-to-date dependencies, plugins, build extensions, repositories, and more. 

## Get it now

All that you need to do is to define our artifact as a parent of your project:

```xml
<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <parent>
    <groupId>org.maxur</groupId>
    <artifactId>maxur-base</artifactId>
    <version>0.7</version>
  </parent>
  <groupId>your-group-id</groupId>
  <artifactId>your-artifact-id</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
  [...]
</project>
```

##Properties

Name | Description | Value | Default Value  
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
env | Target environment | dev, qa, prod | dev 
project.root | For multi-module projects it is the root project path | path | .
project.jdk  | The version of JDK. | java version | 1.8
snapshot.allowed.artifacts | List of dependency patterns to exclude when checking for snapshot versions | list of patterns | org.maxur:*

##Profiles

 - [announcement](#announcement)
 - [clover](#clover)
 - [gh-pages](#gh-pages)
 - [gpg](#gpg)
 - [inspect](#inspect)
 - [site](#site)
 - [sonar](#sonar)
 - [sonatype](#sonatype)
 

###announcement

The profile is activated automatically when you have the target environment as production.

```
$ mvn clean install -Denv=prod
```

Generate an announcement from the announcement template

###clover

The profile is activated automatically when you have a **clover.license** file in a root directory.

It configures [maven-clover2-plugin] (https://docs.atlassian.com/maven-clover2-plugin/2.3.1/) for check and report tasks.

###gh-pages
            
This profile can be activated manually: 

```
$ mvn clean install -Pgh-pages
```

This plugin can deploy site without SSH key by OAuth Token.

*settings.xml*

```xml
<server>
    <id>github</id>
    <password>OAuthToken</password>
</server>
```

It configures site deployment to github pages. See http://pages.github.com/
                    

###gpg

Sign artifacts before installation with GPG. To enable this profile you should have "gpg.keyname" property defined.

[maven-gpg-plugin] (https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-gpg-plugin/) used to GPG-sign the artifact before deployment to foreign
repository. GPG keys have to be provided in CI environment, and published beforehand.

###inspect

The profile is activated automatically when you have the target environment as qa.
This profile can be activated manually:

```
$ mvn clean install -Pinspect
```

It runs a number of checks to make sure the quality of the build is acceptable. 

These plugins are used at the moment to control quality and prevent errors

[maven-duplicate-finder-plugin] (https://github.com/basepom/duplicate-finder-maven-plugin) is a filter of duplicate classes and resources in classpath. 
It helps to identify dependencies that are not used, or the ones that are used but not defined.


[qulice-maven-plugin] (http://www.qulice.com/qulice-maven-plugin/) is a compound static analysis tools that aggregates
 
  * Checkstyle 
  * PMD 
  * FindBugs 
  * CodeNarc (for Groovy code) 
  * a few other plugins in one bucket. 
  
It is expected by default that your **LICENSE.txt** is located in a root directory of every module.

All plugins are bound to the *verify* Maven phase. 
All executions are named *maxur-check*.

###site

The profile builds site for production environment.           

###sonar

The profile is activated automatically when you have a **sonar.properties** file in a root directory.

*sonar.properties*

```properties
sonar.sourceEncoding = UTF-8
sonar.language = java

sonar.host.url = http://192.168.1.1:9000
sonar.jdbc.url = jdbc:postgresql://192.168.1.1:5432/sonar
sonar.jdbc.driverClassName = org.postgresql.Driver
sonar.jdbc.username = sonar
sonar.jdbc.password = sonar

sonar.forceAnalysis = true

sonar.artifact.path=
```

It configures [sonar-maven-plugin] (http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analyzing+with+Maven).

###sonatype
            
The profile deploys all artifacts to oss.sonatype.org repository .
It also skips default deployment plugin.
            
##Implicit Profiles

 - [dep-junit](#dep-junit)
 - [dep-log4j](#dep-log4j)
 - [dep-logback](#dep-logback)
 

###dep-junit
            
Enable unit testing. The profile is activated when you have **src/test/java directory** in the project.
These artifacts are automatically added to the list of dependencies (in test scope, of course):

 * [junit:junit] (http://junit.org/): unit testing framework
 * [org.assertj:assertj-core] (http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/): assertion framework
 * [org.jmockit:jmockit] (http://jmockit.org/): mocking framework
            
###dep-log4j
          
Enable [LOG4J] (http://logging.apache.org/log4j/) for logging and [SLF4J] (http://www.slf4j.org/) binding. The profile is activated when you have **src/test/resources/log4j.properties**.
